Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

Have your drivers assigned to different city types based off of what type of cities they typically work in.
Charge more per mile in urban cities because trips most likely are shorter and drivers dont earn as much per trip.
Make small charge increases or descreases based off of how many riders there are in the city during certain months.
