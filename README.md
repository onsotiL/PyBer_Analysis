# PyBer_Analysis

Resources

-  CSV files found inside of the Resources folder.
-  Software: Python, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook


## Overview 

The purpose of this analysis is to create a summary of PyBer ride-sharing data in different city types including Rural, Urban & Suburban. The summary will help inform the company on the demand for rides and drivers in the three different city types and help the company make decisons on fares and driver distribution.  

#### The analysis calculated the following:
- Total number of rides
- Total number of drivers 
- Total fares for each city type. 
- Average fare per driver for each city type
- Average fare per ride for each city type

## Results

### The Analysis concluded the following:
 
 #### Total rides by city type 
 
- Urban cities: 1,625 rides
- Suburban cities: 625 rides 
- rural citiesâ€‹: 125 rides

The analysis above shows that riders in the rural cities are paying almost $10 more for rides than in urban cities. The average fare in the urban cities is $24.50 while in the rural cities it's about $35. The fare for Suburban cities' is in between at $30.97. On the other hand, the average fare per driver in the rural cities is about $55 while in the urban cities it's about $17. The Suburban cities' average fare per driver is almost $40.

### The results demonstrate the following: 

- Rural cities have the least number of rides, drivers, and total fares.
- Urban cities have the greatest number of rides, drivers, and total fares.
- Suburban cities fall in between rural and urban cities
- Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride 
- Urban cities have the lowest average fare per ride



#### The following multiple-line graph shows the total fares for each week by city type during a time period of 5 months.
#### The following can be concluded: 

- There is a peak in fares in all city types towards the end of February
- The yellow trend depicting urban cities shows that fares totaled from $1,600 to $2,200 during this period
- During the same time, the rural cities depicted by the blue trend only totaled about $300

## Summary 

The information on the disparities among the city types in drives, fares and rides can be used for PYBer to implement some changes including the following 

-  Increasing the fares in the urban cities to compensate drivers who are averaging only $17 per driver, compared to rural cities where the average is $55 
-  A follow up analysis to find out if there is an unmet need for drivers in the rural areas and how to incentivize drives to meet these needs
-  Advertise for drivers in all cities during peak months
